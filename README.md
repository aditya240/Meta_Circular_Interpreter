# Meta_Circular_Interpreter

This is a Interpreter in Racket to evaluate multiple basic (if, cond, lambda, set! etc.), primitive (<, =, +, / etc.) and compound procedures (and, let, force, delay etc.). I have also included multiple tests in the mceval.rkt file. You can simply run the 'run-tests-gui.rkt' file to see a visual representation of the various tests.
